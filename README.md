# Interior point Method for the inner quadratic programming problem in the Big Data analysis
First, download the whole folder and open it in Matlab (Add to path -> selected folders and subfolders)

You can run some tests to see our implementation in action. Be aware that some tests might take a long time to finish.

The first test you can run is test_ipm.m, which is the core of the project. test_ipm.m tries to recover from a noised input signal the original data.

Other tests are test_time.m, which I used to test the performance, test_epsilon.m, which I used to observe the relation between the regularization parameter and the norm of the absolute error.
Also I included all the tests that I used for the plots in the report.
